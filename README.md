OwnTV is a native **Android TV** IPTV **player** built with Kotlin, Jetpack Compose for TV, and a
**dual playback engine** — **libmpv (FFmpeg)** for movies/series and maximum compatibility, **ExoPlayer
(Media3)** for near-instant Live TV. It's a *player only* — you bring your own Xtream login, M3U playlist
(by **URL or a local `.m3u`/`.m3u8` file** on the device), or **Stalker/Ministra portal (Portal URL + MAC
address)**, and OwnTV gives you a fast, modern, remote-first way to browse and watch them.

> ⚠️ OwnTV does **not** provide any channels, playlists, subscriptions, streams, or media content.
> You are responsible for adding your own legally accessible sources.

This is an **open-source** project — the code is original (not derived from any other app) and was
**built with the help of AI**. **Contributions are welcome**: clone, build, and test it freely. It
targets **Android TV only** (leanback launcher, D-pad-first UI).

> ### 📖 New here? Read the [**User Guide & Hidden Features →**](extras/USER_GUIDE.md)
> Long‑press to favourite, **Left** for the channel list (**Left** again to browse categories) and
> **Right** for recently watched, the
> MPV/EXO toggle's **compatibility mode**,
> catch‑up from the Guide, startup landing, A/V‑sync — all the remote shortcuts in one place.

## ✨ Features

### 🎬 Playback
- **Dual engine** — libmpv (FFmpeg) for max compatibility + ExoPlayer for instant Live TV; per-channel toggle and automatic VOD fallback between them
- Zero-copy **4K HDR** direct rendering · opt-in **auto frame rate** (off by default; 24/25/50/60 fps display matching, with the rate measured when a live stream doesn't declare one) · **live buffering you control** (Live latency drives the real buffer, plus a Pre-buffer gate that can be set per playlist) · context-aware channel zapping (D-pad/CH± stays in Favorites, History, All or the opened category) · **self-correcting surround sound** (Auto/Stereo only/Surround, with an audio-output watchdog that falls back to stereo if your TV or soundbar can't actually play it) + 150% volume boost
- **Subtitles** — text (SRT/ASS), image (PGS/VOBSUB/DVB), closed captions, plus OpenSubtitles search & local files with timing adjust; customisable size, colour, position and background transparency
- Resume prompts, next-episode auto-play, mini-player/PiP, **audio-only mode**, and a live codec/resolution/HDR stream-info overlay

### 🧭 Browse
- **Continue Watching** home with TMDB-enriched previews; Live / Movies / Series / Downloads / Guide sections
- Per-profile customizable rows, Favorites & History, bulk rename rules, custom combined categories,
  inline + global search, and a multi-playlist switcher
- **TMDB** posters, plots, cast & trailers **in 40 languages**; scales to ~50k channels / ~168k movies with priority + incremental syncing

### 📥 Sources & EPG
- **Xtream**, **M3U** (typed playlists), and **Stalker/Ministra** MAC portals; add a source from your phone over LAN (QR + PIN)
- XMLTV **TV Guide** grid, **Catch-up TV** (up to 7 days) + live rewind, auto EPG matching, multiple guide sources
- Optional **guide channel logos** — per EPG source, use that feed's own logos instead of your playlist's

### 👥 Profiles & Downloads
- Multiple profiles with own favorites/history/resume, PIN locks, kids flag, "Who's watching?" gate
- Offline movies & episodes — pause/resume/retry, queue groups + storage bar, live poster status strip

### 🎨 Settings & Robustness
- Material 3 theming & accent, **Liquid Glass** frosted look over your own background photo, searchable settings, sidebar/category customization, external player, weather chip
- **Backup & Restore** locally or over Wi-Fi — a single `.own` file carrying your background image, optionally encrypted end to end with your own password (older `.json` backups still restore); in-app updates; memory-safe buffers, no-ANR threading, auto-reconnect, resilient imports & offline detection

## 🧱 Tech stack

| Area | Choice |
|------|--------|
| Language | Kotlin 2.3.10 (AGP 9 **built-in Kotlin**, no `kotlin-android` plugin) |
| Build | AGP 9.2.1 / Gradle 9.4.1, KSP2 2.3.9 |
| UI | Jetpack Compose for TV (`androidx.tv:tv-material` 1.1.0), Compose BOM 2026.05.00 |
| Media | **libmpv** (FFmpeg) — `dev.jdtech.mpv:libmpv` · **ExoPlayer/Media3** (Live TV + image subs) |
| Database | Room 2.8.4 + Paging 3.5.0 + FTS4 (WAL) |
| DI | Koin 4.1.1 |
| Networking | OkHttp |
| Images | Coil 3.3.0 |
| Preferences | DataStore |

`minSdk 26`, `targetSdk 36`, `applicationId tv.own.owntv`.

> **Build note:** Kotlin comes from AGP 9's built-in Kotlin (no `kotlin-android` plugin). KSP 2.3.6+
> supports built-in Kotlin, so Room codegen works alongside it; the Compose compiler and KSP track
> Kotlin 2.3.x.

## ⚙️ How it works (backend)

- **Parsing & sync** — M3U playlists are line-streamed and Xtream `player_api` JSON is read with
  `android.util.JsonReader`, so huge provider payloads are never fully buffered. `SyncManager` does a
  clear-then-insert refresh in ~500-row chunked transactions with Flow progress and cancellation.
- **Storage** — a 27-entity Room schema: profiles & sources (`ProfileSourceCrossRef` for sharing),
  content (categories/channels/movies/series/seasons/episodes), per-profile favorites/history/progress/
  downloads, EPG channels/programmes, external-subtitle cache/selection/timing/links, and FTS4 search
  tables. Totals come from indexed `COUNT` queries.
- **Lists** — Paging 3 with a bounded `maxSize` keeps memory flat across 50k+ item lists.
- **EPG** — bulk XMLTV is stream-parsed (gzip-aware) into a rolling now→+48h window and pruned.
- **Player** — two engines behind a small `PlaybackEngine` interface: **libmpv** (movies/series, and any
  live stream ExoPlayer can't open) and **ExoPlayer/Media3** (Live TV — instant HLS). Live "promotes" the
  running preview straight to full-screen (no reload); the shell hoists the active surface across full ↔
  mini-player. Player state is published as `StateFlow`s for the Compose HUD.
- **DI** — Koin modules (`appModule`, `databaseModule`, `dataModule`, `playerModule`).

## 📥 Installing (Fire TV / Android TV)

Grab the signed APK from the [**latest release**](https://github.com/ahXN00/OwnTV/releases/latest) and
sideload it. A fixed link always points at the newest signed build:

```
https://github.com/ahXN00/OwnTV/releases/latest/download/OwnTV.apk
```

- **Fire TV** — install the **Downloader** app (by AFTVnews) from the Amazon Appstore, then enter the
  **Downloader code `4308278`** (or [`aftv.news/4308278`](https://aftv.news/4308278), which always
  points at the latest signed `OwnTV.apk`). Enable *Apps from Unknown Sources* if prompted.
- **Android TV / Google TV** — the **Downloader** app is also on Google Play, so the same code
  **`4308278`** works here too. (If Downloader doesn't show in search, open the Play Store on the TV —
  you can reach it via *Settings → Apps → See all apps → Show system apps → Google Play Store* — and
  install it from there.) Or just sideload the APK with your tool of choice (*Send files to TV*, a USB
  drive, or `adb install OwnTV.apk`).

> Only install the APK from this repository's official Releases (or the `…/releases/latest/download/OwnTV.apk`
> link above). It's the build signed by this project's CI — third-party re-hosts aren't endorsed.
>
> Releases ship **two APKs**: `OwnTV-vX.X.X.apk` / `OwnTV.apk` (arm: `arm64-v8a` + `armeabi-v7a` — for
> all real Fire TV / Android TV devices, and what the Downloader code fetches), and
> `OwnTV-x86_64-vX.X.X.apk` (for emulators / rare Intel boxes). Real devices always want the arm build.

## 🛠️ Building & running

> Only needed if you want to build from source. Most people can just **[install the ready-made APK](#-installing-fire-tv--android-tv)** instead — no build tools required.

**What you need first**
- **[Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)** (a recent version that supports AGP 9.x) — this bundles the JDK and Android SDK, so you don't install those separately.
- A build target: either a real **Android TV / Fire TV** device (with USB or wireless debugging turned on), or an **Android TV emulator** created from Android Studio's Device Manager.

**Steps**
1. **Get the code** — click the green **Code** button on GitHub → *Download ZIP* (and unzip it), or run `git clone https://github.com/ahXN00/OwnTV.git`.
2. **Open it** — in Android Studio choose **Open**, pick the project folder, and wait for the first **Gradle sync** to finish (it downloads dependencies; give it a few minutes the first time).
3. **Pick the right build variant** — open **Build Variants** (left sidebar) and choose the flavor that matches your target:
   - **`standard`** — real TV/phone/Fire TV devices and arm emulators (`arm64-v8a` + `armeabi-v7a`)
   - **`x86_64`** — x86_64 emulators only
   - This matters: the native libmpv player only loads on a matching ABI, so the wrong choice = no playback.
4. **Press Run** (▶) with your device/emulator selected. The app installs and launches. It shows up in the **TV launcher** on Android TV, and as a normal app icon on phones/tablets too (minimum **Android 8.0 / API 26**).

**Prefer the command line?** From the project folder run `./gradlew assembleDebug` (use `gradlew.bat assembleDebug` on Windows). The APK lands in `app/build/outputs/apk/`.

**First launch** — you'll go through onboarding: accept the disclaimer, create a profile, then **add a source** (M3U, Xtream, or Stalker/MAC portal) — or import a backup. After it imports, browse from the sidebar and open the **Guide** for the EPG. Everything else is under **Settings**.

**Tested on:** a real **TCL Google TV**, and the **Android Studio emulator** (both the Android TV and Google TV system images).
