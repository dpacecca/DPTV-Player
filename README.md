DPTV-Player is a native **Android TV** app for **live TV and sports**, built with Kotlin and Jetpack
Compose for TV. Its **Sports Hub** shows ESPN fixtures, scores, standings and tables for 106 leagues (including Rugby Union and Rugby League)
and matches every fixture against **your own live channels** — names and guide text, both teams
required — so one tap starts playback. It runs **two playback engines** — libmpv (FFmpeg) for the
widest compatibility, ExoPlayer (Media3) for near-instant Live TV — and it is a *player only*: you
bring your own **Xtream** login, **M3U** playlist (URL or a local file) or **Stalker/Ministra**
portal.

> ⚠️ DPTV-Player ships **no** channels, playlists, subscriptions or streams. You are responsible for the
> sources you add.

Open source, GPLv3. Forked from [OwnTV](https://github.com/ahXN00/OwnTV) — thanks for the shoulders.
**Android TV only** — leanback launcher, D-pad first.

### Project layout

This repository is the **Android TV app**. Everything underneath it — database, sync, parsers, EPG,
backup, settings storage, the playback engines and every translated string — is the core
library in [`core-lib/`](core-lib/) (`tv.own.owntv:core` / `:player-core`), built together with the
app as a Gradle composite build.

## 📥 Installing (Fire TV / Android TV)

Grab the signed APK from the [**latest release**](https://github.com/dpacecca/DPTV-Player/releases/latest)
and sideload it with *Send files to TV*, a USB drive, or `adb install DPTV-Player-vX.Y.Z.apk`.

> Install only from this repository's Releases. Each release ships **two APKs**, both named with
> their version: `DPTV-Player-vX.Y.Z.apk` (arm — every real TV box) and
> `DPTV-Player-x86_64-vX.Y.Z.apk` (emulators and rare Intel boxes).

## 🛠️ Building & running

> Only if you want to build from source — otherwise just install the APK.

The core library builds from `core-lib/` alongside the app; only the mpv engine is downloaded, from
upstream OwnTV's public Maven repository — **no account or token needed**.

1. **Get the code** — `git clone https://github.com/dpacecca/DPTV-Player.git` (or download the ZIP).
2. **Open it** in [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) and let Gradle sync.
3. **Pick the build variant** — `standard` for real devices and arm emulators, `x86_64` for x86_64
   emulators. This matters: the native player only loads on a matching ABI.
4. **Run** ▶. Minimum **Android 8.0 / API 26**.

Command line: `./gradlew assembleDebug` (`gradlew.bat` on Windows). The APK lands in
`app/build/outputs/apk/`.

## Help translate OwnTV

If your language is already available, contribute interface translations across OwnTV's six Android resource components on [Hosted Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/owntv/). If it is not listed, [open a language request ticket](https://github.com/ahXN00/OwnTV/issues/new?template=feature_request.yml&title=%5BLanguage%5D%20Add%20) first. A maintainer will review the request, register the locale, and prepare its base translation files on Hosted Weblate. Once the language appears on Hosted Weblate, you can start translating it there. The strings themselves live in [OwnTV's core library repository](https://github.com/ahXN00/OwnTV_Core), together with the language contributor guide covering identifiers, validation, and promotion policy.

Thank you to Weblate and to every translator. (Strings live upstream — translation happens on the
OwnTV project and merges down.)

### ▶️ Playback engines

- **[mpv](https://mpv.io/)** (via [libmpv](https://github.com/mpv-android/mpv-android), built on
  [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/)) — the default engine, for the widest IPTV/codec, audio and HDR support.
- **[Media3 / ExoPlayer](https://github.com/androidx/media)** — the fast-start engine for Live TV
  preview and HLS.
